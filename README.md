## Why I Built This

As a student applying to multiple internships and jobs, I needed a tool to keep track of when and where I submitted applications. This inspired me to build a simple daily tracker that could benefit not only myself but also others in different scenarios such as managing household bills, scheduling tasks, or tracking progress.
